# AI-Powered Image Search – Canadian Tire (Capstone Project)

🚀 **Overview**  
This capstone project proposes an AI-powered image search engine for Canadian Tire's digital platforms (e-commerce, mobile app, and gift registry). It aims to enhance product discovery, improve customer experience, and maintain competitiveness in the retail space.

🧠 **Problem**  
Canadian Tire relies on basic text-based search and barcode scanning, which limits user experience, especially for gift registry and watchlist features. Competitors have adopted advanced AI solutions, putting pressure on Canadian Tire to modernize.

✅ **Proposed Solution**  
An AI-based visual search tool that allows users to upload or capture product images and receive accurate search results. The tool integrates into Canadian Tire’s platforms using API-driven architecture and aligns with privacy standards (PIPEDA).

🔧 **Technology Stack**  
- **Tools:** Power BI, Azure AI, Tableau, Excel  
- **Methods:** High-level & low-level system design, API integration, business case analysis  
- **Team Role:** IT Business Analyst (Jacob Smith Rajendran)  
- **Team Size:** 6 members (cross-functional collaboration)

📊 **Key Deliverables**  
- Feasibility study comparing three implementation options: partnership, outsourcing, or status quo  
- ROI and impact analysis (5-year)  
- System architecture with secure API integration  
- Transition requirements and risk mitigation plan  
- ERD, database design for AI product matching  
- Final recommendation: **Outsourcing (Option B)** due to higher ROI and faster deployment
